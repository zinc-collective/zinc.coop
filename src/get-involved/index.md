---

There are many ways to get involved with Zinc collective and support our vision for a post-scarcity world.

### Join the chat

Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/QK9VVg4D">Discord Server</a> and introduce yourself and get to know the community.

### Learning Ensembles

Improve your coding skills in a supportive, non-judgemental setting with a group of peers that have decades of hands-on industry experience. Join our weekly ensembles and contribute to one of our active projects like <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/convene#contributing-to-convene">Convene</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/mp-shake-it-photo#become-a-contributor">Moment Park</a>. Ensembles are organized in the style of <em>choose your own adventure</em> mob programming sessions. Programmers, designers, and product folks of all levels are encouraged to join and contribute any and all skills that apply to building software applications.

### Touch Grass

Eat pizza by the lake.

### Seeking Capacity Builders
One of our biggest challenges at the moment is supporting folks who want to contribute to our software products. We believe Convene can be an impactful, non-extractive alternative to enshitified Saas products. But we aren't making any money yet. Our members and volunteer contributors are all working pro-bono at the moment. But we'd like to change that.

If you're interested or have skills in organizational/community development and capacity-building, we'd love your help strategizing to create paid opportunities for volunteer contributors.

### Seeking Product Stewardshippers

We also need help from folks with skills in project management, product management, and product design to help steward our partner relationships and create meaningful, human-centered experiences for our products.
