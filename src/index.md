## Welcome to Zinc ðŸ¤—
We are a worker-owned collective of technologists that build ethical, human-centered software for the solidarity economy.

## Relationship, abundance, joy

Zinc is a new kind of technogy commmunity based in care and a vision of a post-scarcity society. We invite humans from diverse backgrounds and skill levels to be in deeper connection by working together on software projects that are mutually beneficial for coop Members, volunteer contributors, and the Client Owners who serve in their communities. Work on what you want, when you want. Enjoy your work. Learn and mentor in our weekly ensembles. Join us for grass touching and pizza at our regional Bay Area meetup for casual conversation and networking with folks from other coops and the coop-curious.

# Principles

*   Creating and capturing value with human-centered, sustainable digital products and services.
*   Redistributing that wealth in a way that rectifies socioeconomic power imbalances.
*   Taking responsibility for and reducing the social and ecological costs of our digital products and services.
